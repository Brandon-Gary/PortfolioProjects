# PortfolioProjects
Here I display some different SQL queries, Python code, and dashboards I have developed during both my educational and professional career.

The Jupyter Notebook files are chunks of code I would use for various aggregation of data that leadership would regularly request. Data was frequently extracted using the REDCap API, but to protect the confidentiality of API tokens, it is shown here as being read from a csv format off the local device in a generic file path.

Dasbhoards or maps are fully interactive, although only screenshots are shown here. Public links to the live versions of the dashboard can be shared at the request of an interviewer.
